##Makerspace

They have Arduino and Raspberry Pi kits, as well as 3D printers, Lego Mindtorms, and other neat tech stuff you can play with as well as people there to help you if you need to understand something. Use makerspaceinfo@kean.edu to get more information/E-mail them informing them you want to come.

If you have any questions, let me know. I hope this was helpful.

1. The Stack Exchange network in general is very helpful so check it out, they have sites devoted to specific things, e.g. [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/), [Arduino](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/), and [Programmers](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/), I'm particular fond of [Code Review](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/), this is [my profile](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/49181/legato) if you're interested.
2. CodeEval is the one I mentioned that unlocks applications to jobs, there are others like it of course, but I like the way this one is set up and the questions are similar to what you will be asked in an interview. [My profile](https://www.codeeval.com/profile/Javaliant/).
3. Unlike the others this is just for those who may want/need typing practice. I find it pretty helpful/fun especially if you like competition.
4. I particularly recommend this, it's why I fell in love with this field and switched majors. They really hand-hold you through the stuff so you understand everything that's going on.
5. Both of thse have some free stuff but also paid content. Udemy has a lot more completely free courses, and even the paid stuff have fantastic sales. Codeschool is worth mentioning since most courses have free introductory parts. For instance,[git real](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real).
