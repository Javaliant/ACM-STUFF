If you have any questions, let me know. I hope this was helpful.

1. The Stack Exchange network in general is very helpful so check it out, they have sites devoted to specific things, e.g. [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/), [Arduino](http://arduino.stackexchange.com/), and [Programmers](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/), I'm particular fond of [Code Review](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/), this is [my profile](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/49181/legato) if you're interested.
2. CodeEval is the one I mentioned that unlocks applications to jobs, there are others like it of course, but I like the way this one is set up and the questions are similar to what you will be asked in an interview. [My profile](https://www.codeeval.com/profile/Javaliant/).
3. I particularly recommend this, it's why I fell in love with this field and switched majors. They really hand-hold you through the stuff so you understand everything that's going on.
4. Both of thse have some free stuff but also paid content. Udemy has a lot more completely free courses, and even the paid stuff have fantastic sales. Codeschool is worth mentioning since most courses have free introductory parts. For instance,[git real](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real).
